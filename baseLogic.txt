Trail Ventures System Basic configurations

When a guide creates a trip (Trip table configuration):
	-> mountain - Stara Planina, Pirin, Rila, Rodopi, Vitosha, Strandja, Sakar
	-> does the trip include a sleepover at a lodge -> sleepover tents?
		--> if sleepover checked -> new fields
			::
			lodge (another table of the database)-> chekckbox ->if checked 
						-> lodge for staying
						-> price per night
			tents -> inform the user where the sleepover will be
	-> sign up for a bus? ->price for ticket otherwise travel by car
	-> start point
	-> guide sets initial price of trip and price should up if lodge or bus is included
	-> description
	-> additional info - not mandatory - what is needed for the trip??
	-> max size of the group to be created

	----When a user signs up for a trip system should check if he is not already signed for one of those dates
	----Wjen a guide creates a trip system should check for overlaping dates with other of his created trips (if any)

	-> mobile phone? -add later
	-> personal info

When a user applies to be a guide (only registered users) (Guide table):
	-> mobile phone - MANDATORY
	-> years of experience
	-> evidence of experience?? -should be approved by admin?
